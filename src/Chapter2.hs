Parentheses and Association

-- 1. parenthese matters because multiplication
-- has higher precedence

a = 8 + 7 * 9
a' = (8 + 7) * 9
checkparen1 = "Should not be the same, are they? " ++ show (a == a') ++ ". Good."


-- 2. parenthese don't matter because they are just restating
-- multiplication precedence

perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
perimeter' x y = x * 2 + y * 2
checkparen2 = "Should be the same, are they? " ++ show (perimeter 7 2 == perimeter' 7 2) ++ ". Good."


-- 3. parentheses matter because diviion has higher precedence
f x = x / 2 + 9
f' x = x / (2 + 9)
checkparen3 = "Should not be the same, are they? " ++ show (f 3 == f' 3) ++ ". Good."
